/*!
This crate offers versioned CRUD operations for entities.

Any entity is modified using events. Every event is either of type create, update or delete.

You can use the [`Repository`] struct to use a nice abstraction for the underlying event logs,
or use the [`Projector`] struct to access the lower-level operations of event projection.

[`Repository`]: core/repository/struct.Repository.html
[`Projector`]: core/projector/struct.Projector.html
